### Open Questions

- How do we new add application status (like reapplied)
- Are we intending to have committee different from pool owner ? When are these committee owners set ?
- How does approval work? Does everyone have to vote / Is it one vote enough ? 

## Variations

The allocation strategy can be customized for different usecase

- Application Gating 
    - update constructor (if applicable)
    - update applyToRound to invoke contracts to check gating
- Allocation / Milestone Payout Gating
    - allocators could have SBT/ EAS
    - allocator could just be pool owners
- Not using registry. AKA no projectID 
    - in these cases, an applicationID would have to be generated by the AllocationStrategy

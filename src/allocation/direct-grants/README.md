#### New Variables
```javascript

struct Application {
    MetaPtr metaPtr;
    address identityId;
    address recipientAddress;
    uint256 requestedAmount;
    ApplicationStatus status;
}

// stores mapping from identityId -> Application
mapping (address => Application[]) public applications;

```

#### New Functions

Functions around actual functionality

```javascript

function isClaimable() external pure returns (bool) {
    // To show that this strategy is not claimable
    return false;
}

function reviewApplications(bytes[] memory _data) external {
    // decode data to get list of 
    //  - identityId
    //  - index of application (to know which milestone)
    //  - status
    
    // update application status in applications mapping
}
```


### Open Questions

- Is there an application period ? 
- Are we intending to have committee different from pool owner ? When are these committee owners set ?
- Update IAllocationStrategy.allocate to accept msg.sender as argument (set by IAllo)

## Variations

The allocation strategy can be customized for different usecase

- Application Gating 
    - update constructor (if applicable)
    - update applyToRound to invoke contracts to check gating
- Allocation Gating
    - allocators could have SBT/ EAS
    - allocator could just be pool owners
- Not using registry. AKA no projectID 
    - in these cases, an applicationID would have to be generated by the AllocationStrategys
